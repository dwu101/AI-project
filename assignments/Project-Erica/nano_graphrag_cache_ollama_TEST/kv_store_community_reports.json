    "report_string": "# Community Analysis Report: Bootstrap CSS Framework\n\nThe community analyzed is centered around the Bootstrap CSS framework, which provides pre-built CSS and HTML components to help developers create responsive web applications. The report will examine the structure of this community, highlighting key entities and their relationships.\n\n## Bootstrap's core entities: CSS, HTML, JavaScript\n\nThe community primarily revolves around three core technologies: CSS for styling, HTML for structuring content, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. These technologies are heavily interconnected, with Bootstrap providing a framework that bridges the gaps between them.      The relationships between these entities can be observed through various data sources, including the codebase of Bootstrap itself, as well as the community's documentation and discussion forums. For instance, CSS is used to define styles for HTML elements, which are then manipulated using JavaScript. This synergy demonstrates the power of combining different technologies to create robust web applications.      Furthermore, the presence of CSS variables in Bootstrap's codebase highlights the importance of this technology in defining custom styles. The use of CSS variables also underscores the flexibility and customization capabilities that Bootstrap offers developers.\n\n## Bootstrap's dependencies on other frameworks and libraries\n\nThe community relies heavily on other popular web development frameworks and libraries, such as Quarto for styling and JavaScript libraries like jQuery. This reliance creates a network of interconnected entities, with each entity playing a crucial role in the overall ecosystem.      The relationships between these dependencies can be observed through codebase analysis, with Bootstrap incorporating various libraries to provide additional functionality. For instance, the inclusion of jQuery allows developers to leverage its event handling and DOM manipulation capabilities within their Bootstrap-based applications.      These dependencies also demonstrate the importance of collaboration and integration between different technologies in web development.\n\n## Impact severity rating: 8.5\n\nThe high impact severity rating is due to the widespread adoption and influence of Bootstrap on modern web development. As a popular framework, it has significant implications for developers, designers, and users alike.      The rating also reflects the potential risks associated with relying heavily on Bootstrap, such as the possibility of dependencies becoming outdated or being replaced by newer technologies.      Furthermore, the rating considers the positive impact that Bootstrap has had on the web development community, including its role in promoting best practices for responsive design and accessibility.",
